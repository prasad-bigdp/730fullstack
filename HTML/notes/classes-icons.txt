Always prefer writing HTML with Semantic Elements
Symbols: if we want any symbols or emojis , we can use symbol code which are followed by '&' like &gt;,&lt;,&copy;,&#128513; etc..,
You can also use VS Code shortcut windows+. , you will get a modal with emojis
ICons: if we want to involve icons, best library is font-awesome icons, 

how to use font awesome?
goto google type "cdn font awesome" , goto cdn website and copy the first link  or you also get it from below
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.5.2/css/all.min.css" integrity="sha512-SnH5WK+bZxgPHs44uWIX+LLJAJ9/2PkPKZ5QiAj6Ta86w+fsb2TkcmfRyVX3pBnMFcV7oQPJkl9QevSCWr3W6A==" crossorigin="anonymous" referrerpolicy="no-referrer" />
copy the link and paste in html head , and goto font awesome copy any icon ypu like and paste in HTML Body


We can also give names to HTML Elements in two ways classes and id.
One Element may have multiple class names and multiple Elements may have same class name but id is always unique for the element
