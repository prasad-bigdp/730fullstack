         <h2> I received a job offer mid-course, and
				the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I
				joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s worth.</h2> 
        <p>
          “ I was an EMT for
				many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a
				transition and have heard some people who had an amazing experience
				here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun!
				I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
				grueling - time of my life. Since completing the course, I’ve
				successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
				startup. ”

				Jonathan Walters Verified Graduate The team was very supportive and kept
				me motivated “ I started as a total newbie with virtually no coding
				skills. I now work as a mobile engineer for a big company. This was one
				of the best investments I’ve made in myself. ”
			</div>
			<div class="box box3">
				Jeanette Harmon Verified Graduate An overall wonderful and rewarding
				experience “ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a job I
				really enjoy, and make a good living while doing something I love. ”
			</div>
			<div class="box box4">
				Patrick Abrams Verified Graduate Awesome teaching support from TAs who
				did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning
				from their experiences was easy. “ The staff seem genuinely concerned
				about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program gave me
				the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present
				myself as a capable junior developer. The standard is above the rest.
				You will get the personal attention you need from an incredible
				community of smart and amazing people. ”

			<div class="box box5">
				Kira Whittle Verified Graduate Such a life-changing experience. Highly
				recommended! “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
				code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
				programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student
				of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The
				entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on
				and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
				particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a
				way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it
				during interviews as an example of my developent experience. It
				certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
				multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
