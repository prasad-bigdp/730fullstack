Data types are used to define the type of Data.
JS is dynamically typed Language. variables won't have a constant type.
There are two categories of data types.
1. Primitive: 
  Primitve data types refers always values.
   popular primitve datatypes of js are 
     a. number:
     In Js any numerical value will be number only. To get different operations on number you can use Math functions
     It can use some default fns:
     toFixed(no_of_decimal_digits)
     toPrecision(no_of_totalDigits)
     tostring(base)- converts decimal into another base
     we can also use Math functions:
     Math.max,Math.min,Math.floor,Math.ceil,Math.round,Math.random(generates random value from 0.0-1.0),Math.sqrt,Math.cbrt,Math.pow etc..,
     b. string: strings are nothing but an array of characters
     eg: let x= "prasad", x stores "prasad" where eah character with index starting from 0,

     In JS strings '' or "" are similar. There are three ways you can represent strings.
     single quotation('raj'), double quotation(""), backticks(`raj`)
     based on sitiuation, you can use single/double quotations
     using backticks is template literal which is also introduced in ES6 and it can used to print values withput breaking flow of string

     strings also have some default library methods like 
     length,
     toUppercase,
     toLowerCase,
     indexOf,lastIndexOf
     charAt,
     split,
     replace,
     trim,
     startsWith,
     endsWith,
     slice
     In JS strings are immutable , you cannot change/alter strings
     c. boolean : boolean is used to store true/false. true also considers as 1 and false is 0
     d. undefined: undefined represents accidental absence of value
     e. null: null represents complete absence of value
2. Non-Primitive
